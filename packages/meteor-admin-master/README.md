Meteor Admin
============
This package is a modified copy of

[Meteor admin](https://github.com/yogiben/meteor-admin/)   

which is used instead of the [original](https://github.com/yogiben/meteor-admin/) because it fixes [this issue](https://github.com/yogiben/meteor-admin/pull/289).

The modified copy was downloaded [here](https://github.com/CaptainN/meteor-admin)
