      <!-- "yield" is a special template helper provided by the Iron Router package.
        It lets us reuse this layout template since "yield" defines a dynamic region and
        acts like a placeholder for content. That content will change according to the current
        route, i.e. the template that corresponds to the current route will automatically be
        rendered inside the "yield" region.
        cf. https://github.com/iron-meteor/iron-router/blob/devel/Guide.md#layouts [as of 2015-04-21]
